Sushi , meaning "to cook without flame", is now the generalised and largely misunderstood term used to describe small 
portions of raw food that have been prepared for human consumption. It is said that true Sushi only exists in Japan 
as it is the only country in the world that has banned fire. Sushi prepared outside of Japan 
is commonly referred to as Shitsushi in Japan and is widely ridiculed by elder members of Japanese society.â€¬
