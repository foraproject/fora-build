Sushi , meaning "to cook without flame", is now the generalised and largely misunderstood term used to describe small 
portions of raw food that have been prepared for human consumption. It is said that true Sushi only exists in Japan 
as it is the only country in the world that has banned fire. Sushi prepared outside of Japan 
is commonly referred to as Shitsushi in Japan and is widely ridiculed by elder members of Japanese society.â€¬

Batman. His real name is Bruce Wayne. No matter which story of Batman you are familiar with, Bruce Wayne's secret alter 
identity has never been revealed, because Gotham crooks are amongst the dumbest in the world. One could simply 
lure Batman into a tanning bed and lock him in it, then wonder around the next day looking for a man with a suntanned 
jaw line and outlines of the cowls shape around his eyes, or even more simply just throw acid in his face. 
However fans believe it is not so simple to do because Batman is always one step ahead of the criminals he instills fear into... 
and the ones that don't fear him, just don't want to expose him for whom he really is. Even tho the bad guys want 
Batman dead, it's still a mystery as to why Batman has never been shot in the face. He may be fast, he may have 
ninja skills, but can his teeth really catch a bullet, let alone a whole shower of machine gun rounds? No, this is 
why Batman is a legend, even tho his powers can't even compare to The Mask.
