Robin. Robin is the side kick of Batman. His real name is Dick Glazin, and his alter ego is often referred to as Wonder Boy, 
Nightwing-Boy. He first appeared in the comics, and was considered as stupid of a character as 
when Superman comics introduced Superman's new helpers Supergirl, Supercat, and Superdog. The character of Robin 
was left out from Tim Burton's first two Batman installments, but was introduced in the next two Burton versions 
that were not Burton films. Dick's back-story was the same as how Batman became The Batman, only Dick was 
not a multimillionaire so he had to leach of Bruce Wayne.
